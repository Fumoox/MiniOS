# MiniOS

your computer's new rebellious little sibling

---

## what even is this

so you know those big serious operating systems that take themselves way too seriously? this isn't that.

MiniOS is what happens when you give Python some coffee and tell it to pretend it's an OS. It's small, it's weird, and it doesn't care about being "production-ready."

## cool stuff you can do

- **mess with processes** (but like, safely)
- **pretend you're a hacker** in the command line
- **play games** when you're supposed to be coding
- **earn points** for absolutely no reason
- **break things** without breaking your actual computer

## how to start this thing

```bash
# the magic words
python pipoos.py
```
## logins that work:

```bash
admin / admin123 #feel important
```
```bash
user / user123 #keep it casual
```
## commands that won't disappoint
- text
- help    - see what you can break
- info    - feel like a sysadmin
- ps      - spy on your processes
- ls      - see what files are hiding
- game    - procrastinate properly
- exit    - return to the real world
  ## why does this exist
- you were curious how OSes work

- you got bored during class

- you wanted to build something that doesn't suck

- all of the above

## wanna make it better?
fix my bad code, add something cool, or just tell me what's broken. i'm not offended.

not your dad's operating system :D
